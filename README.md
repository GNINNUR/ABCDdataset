# ABCD dataset

This note describes ABCD (AIST Building Change Detection) dataset.
This dataset is a new labeled dataset, specifically geared toward constructing and evaluating damage detection systems to identify whether buildings have been washed-away by tsunami.
The paper: 

## Format
Each datum in this dataset is a pair of pre- and post-tsunami aerial image patches, and encompasses a target building at the center of the patch. These pairs were cropped from aerial images taken before and after the Tohoku earthquake.

Using this dataset, we comprehensively evaluate CNNs from a practical-application viewpoint, e.g., input scenarios (pre-tsunami images are not always available), input scales (building size varies) and different configurations for CNNs. The experimental results show that our CNN-based washedaway detection system achieves 94â€“96% classification accuracy across all conditions, indicating the promising applicability of CNNs for washed-away building detection.

----
This is a ABCD dataset meant for research purposes.

There are XXX images for each of the following classes:
- washed-away
- surviving

Each image measures XXXxXXX pixels.

The images were manually extracted from large images from the USGS National Map Urban Area Imagery collection for various urban areas around the country. The pixel resolution of this public domain imagery is 1 foot.
