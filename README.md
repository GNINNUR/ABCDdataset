# ABCD dataset

This note describes ABCD (AIST Building Change Detection) dataset, which is a dataset dedicated for constructing automatic damage detection models.

To this end, we compile a dedicated,
labeled aerial image dataset to construct models that classify whether a building is washed-away. Each datum in the set is a pair of pre- and post-tsunami image patches and encompasses a target building at the center of the patch. Using this dataset, we comprehensively
evaluate CNNs from a practical-application viewpoint, e.g., input scenarios (pre-tsunami images are not always available), input scales (building size varies) and different configurations for CNNs. The experimental results show that our CNN-based washedaway
detection system achieves 94â€“96% classification accuracy across all conditions, indicating the promising applicability of CNNs for washed-away building detection.
